        <p>A website is <strong> a collection of files accessed through a web address, covering a particular theme or
                subject,
                and managed by a particular person or organization.</strong> Its opening page is called a home page.</p>
        <p> <strong> A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that share a single domain
                name.
                Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a
                variety
                of purposes.</strong> Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web. <br>
            <br>
            Although it is sometimes called “web page,” this definition is wrong, since a website consists of several
            webpages. A website is also known as a “web presence” or simply “site”.

        <p>- Known as a web.
            - Is a collenction of website or web pages stored in web servers. <br>
            - Connected to local computers through the internet. <br>
            - These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. <br>
            - Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world using computers, laptops, cell
            phones,
            etc. <br>
            - The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device. <br>

        <h2>WWW - How internet works?
        </h2>
        <p>- A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. <br>
            - Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your
            computer.
            <br>
            - One of the best features of the internet is the ability to communicate almost instantls with anyone in the

            - Email is one of the oldest and most universal ways to communicate and share information on the internet,
            and
            bilions of people use it. Social media allows people to connect in a variety of ways and build communities

        <!-- HTTP/HTTPS -->
        <h1>HTTP/HTTPS</h1>
        <h2>HTTP</h2>
        <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and
            web
            servers. HTTP allows the transfer of hypertext, which includes HTML documents, images, videos, and other
            resources, over the internet. <br> <br>

            When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, the browser
            sends
            an HTTP request to the web server hosting that URL. The server then responds to the request, sending back
            the
            requested data, typically in the form of an HTML document. <br> <br>

            HTTP follows a client-server model, where the client (typically a web browser) initiates a request to the
            server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message. The communication between the
            client and the server happens over a TCP/IP connection.</p> <br> <br>
        <h2>HTTPS</h2>
        <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol used for secure communication over a
            computer network, most commonly the internet. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, which is the protocol
            used
            for transferring data between a web browser and a website. <br> <br>

            The primary purpose of HTTPS is to provide encryption and secure authentication of the website that users
            are
            connecting to. It ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and the website remains confidential
            and
            cannot be intercepted or tampered with by attackers. <br> <br>

            HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt the data. When
            a
            user connects to a website over HTTPS, their browser and the website's server establish a secure connection
            by
            exchanging SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates verify the authenticity of the website and enable the
            encryption of data transmitted between the two parties.</p> <br> <br>

        <!-- Client-Server -->
        <h1>Client-Server</h1>
        <p>A client-server architecture is a common model used in computer networking and distributed systems. In this
            architecture, the communication and interaction between devices are divided into two main roles: the client
            and
            the server. <br></p>
        <p>
        <h2>Clinet- server communication </h2>
        <h3> 1. Client "sometimes on" </h3>
        - Intiates a request to the server when interested <br>
        - Ex. web browser on your laptop or cell phone <br>
        - Doesn't communicate directly with other clients <br>
        - needs to know the server's address <br> <br>

        <h3>2. Server is "always on"</h3>
        - Services requests frome many client hosts <br>
        - Ex. Wev server for the www.example.com web site <br>
        - Doesn't initiate contract with the clients <br>
        - Needs a fixed, well-known address <br> <br>
        </p> <br> <br>
        <hr>
        <!-- Domain -->
        <h1>Domain</h1>
        <p>In the context of computer networking and the Internet, a domain refers to a unique name that identifies a
            website or a network of devices. It is part of a larger hierarchical naming system called the Domain Name
            System
            (DNS), which translates domain names into their corresponding IP addresses. <br> <br>

            A domain name is typically composed of two or more parts, separated by dots. The rightmost part is the
            top-level
            domain (TLD), which represents the highest level in the domain name hierarchy. Examples of TLDs include
            .com,
            .org, .net, .edu, .gov, and country-specific TLDs such as .uk, .de, or .jp. <br> <br>

            The part to the left of the TLD is the second-level domain (SLD) and is often chosen to represent a specific
            organization, business, or topic. For example, in the domain name <strong><ins> "example.com,"</ins>
                "example"
            </strong>is the SLD.
            Further
            subdomains can be added to the left of the SLD to create additional levels of organization or
            categorization.
            For instance, "www" is a commonly used subdomain for the World Wide Web, resulting in the complete domain
            name
            <strong><ins> "www.example.com."</ins></strong> <br> <br>
        </p> <br> <br>
        <hr>
        <!-- Hosting -->
        <h1>Hosting</h1>
        <p>Hosting refers to the process of storing, serving, and making websites or web applications accessible on the
            Internet. It involves allocating resources, such as disk space, bandwidth, and computing power, to host and
            serve the files and data associated with a website. <br> <br>

            Web hosting providers are companies that offer services and technologies to store and serve websites on
            their
            servers. When you sign up for a hosting service, you essentially rent space on their servers to store your
            website files, databases, and other related assets. The hosting provider ensures that your website is
            available
            to be accessed by users on the Internet. <br>

        <h3>There are different types of hosting services available, including:</h3>

        <strong> 1. Shared Hosting:</strong> In shared hosting, multiple websites are hosted on a single server, and
        resources such as
        CPU, memory, and disk space are shared among them. This is a cost-effective option suitable for small websites
        or
        those with moderate traffic. <br> <br>

        <strong>2. Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting:</strong> VPS hosting involves dividing a physical server into
        multiple
        virtual servers, where each website or application has its dedicated resources. It provides more control,
        privacy,
        and scalability compared to shared hosting. <br> <br>

        <strong> 3. Dedicated Server Hosting:</strong> With dedicated hosting, you have an entire physical server
        dedicated solely to
        your website or application. This option offers the highest level of control, performance, and flexibility,
        making
        it suitable for high-traffic websites or resource-intensive applications. <br> <br>

        <strong> 4. Cloud Hosting:</strong> Cloud hosting utilizes multiple interconnected servers to host websites or
        applications.
        It offers scalability and redundancy, as resources can be dynamically allocated based on demand. Cloud hosting
        can
        be a good option for websites with fluctuating traffic or for those requiring high availability. <br> <br>

        <strong>5. Managed WordPress Hosting:</strong> This type of hosting is specifically optimized for WordPress
        websites. The
        hosting provider takes care of WordPress-specific tasks, such as updates, security, and performance
        optimizations,
        allowing you to focus on your website content. <br> <br></p> <br> <br>
        <hr>
        <!-- Host -->
        <h1>Host</h1>
        <p>In web development, the term "host" refers to the act of making a website or web application accessible on
            the
            Internet by storing its files and data on a server that is connected to the World Wide Web.

            When you develop a website or web application, it typically consists of various files such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, images, and databases. These files need to be stored on a server and made available for users to
            access through their web browsers.

        <h3>To host a website or web application, you need to follow these steps:</h3>

        <strong> 1. Choose a hosting provider:</strong> Select a hosting provider that offers the type of hosting
        service that suits
        your website's requirements. Consider factors such as server reliability, storage space, bandwidth, technical
        support, and cost. <br> <br>

        <strong>2. Register a domain: </strong> If you don't already have a domain name, you'll need to register one. A
        domain name is
        the unique address that users will use to access your website (e.g., www.example.com). <br> <br>

        <strong> 3. Set up the hosting account:</strong> Sign up for a hosting plan with the chosen provider and follow
        their
        instructions to set up your hosting account. This may involve creating an account, choosing a hosting package,
        and
        providing your domain name. <br> <br>

        <strong> 4. Upload website files:</strong> Use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client or the hosting provider's
        provided tools
        to upload your website files to the server. This includes all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, image, and other necessary
        files. <br> <br>

        <strong>5. Configure databases and server settings:</strong> If your website requires a database (e.g., for
        storing user
        information or dynamic content), you will need to set up the database on the server and configure the necessary
        settings. <br> <br>

        <strong> 6. Test and launch:</strong> Once your website files are uploaded and configured, test your website to
        ensure that it
        functions correctly. Make sure all links work, forms submit data properly, and any dynamic functionality
        functions
        as expected. Once you are satisfied with the testing, you can officially launch your website, making it
        accessible
        to users on the Internet. <br> <br></p> <br> <br>

        <!-- FTP -->
        <h1>FTP</h1>
        <p>FTP, which stands for File Transfer Protocol, is a standard network protocol used for transferring files
            between
            a client and a server on a computer network. It provides a simple and efficient way to upload, download, and
            manage files on a remote server. <br>

        <h3>Here's how FTP typically works:</h3>

        <strong> 1. Client-Server Communication:</strong> The FTP client (usually a software application) establishes a
        connection
        with the FTP server using a specified port (usually port 21 for standard FTP). The client and server communicate
        over this connection using FTP commands and responses. <br> <br>

        <strong> 2. Authentication: </strong>The client provides credentials (username and password) to authenticate
        itself with the
        FTP server. Once authenticated, the client gains access to the files and directories available on the server.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>3. Navigating the Directory Structure:</strong> The client can navigate the directory structure of the
        server to
        locate and access specific files or directories. FTP provides commands like "cd" (change directory), "ls" (list
        files and directories), and "pwd" (print working directory) to navigate and manage the server's file system.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>4. File Transfer:</strong> The client can initiate file transfers between the local machine and the
        server. FTP
        supports commands such as "get" (download a file from the server to the client), "put" (upload a file from the
        client to the server), and "delete" (remove a file from the server). During file transfer, data is transmitted
        over
        a separate data connection established by the FTP protocol. <br> <br>

        <strong> 5. Passive and Active Modes:</strong> FTP can operate in two modes: passive and active. In the active
        mode, the
        server initiates the data connection back to the client for file transfers. In the passive mode, the client
        initiates the data connection to the server. The choice of mode depends on the network configuration and
        firewall
        settings.</p> <br> <br>
        <hr>
        <!-- Path -->
        <h1>Path</h1>
        <p>In web development, a "path" typically refers to the specific location or route within a website or web
            application. <strong>It is part of the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) </strong> that specifies the location
            of a
            particular resource or page on a server. <br> <br>

            A path is represented as a string of characters that comes after the domain name in a URL. It helps the
            server
            identify the specific resource or page that the user is requesting. For example, in the URL <strong>
                <ins> "https://www.example.com/products/category1/item1"</ins> </strong>, the path
            "/products/category1/item1" represents the
            specific path to the item1 page within the category1 section of the products on the example.com website.</p>
        <br> <br>
        <hr>
        <!-- Extension -->
        <h1>Extension</h1>
        <p>A filename extension, file name extension or file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file
            <strong> (e.g.,
                .txt, .docx, .md).</strong> The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its
            intended use. A
            filename extension is typically delimited from the rest of the filename with a full stop (period), but in
            some
            systems it is separated with spaces. Other extension formats include dashes and/or underscores on early
            versions
            of Linux and some versions of IBM AIX. <br> <br>

            Some file systems implement filename extensions as a feature of the file system itself and may limit the
            length
            and format of the extension, while others treat filename extensions as part of the filename without special
            distinction.

        <!-- URL-URI/URN -->
        <h1>URL-URI/URN</h1>
        <h2>URL</h2>
        <h3>Defination of URL</h3>
        <p> <strong> A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the
                Internet.</strong> It is
            also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name --
            that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.</p>
        <p>
        <h3> URL -- Uniform Resource Locator</h3>
        Contains information about how to fetch a resource from its location. For example: <br> <br>

        <strong><ins> http://example.com/mypage.html <br> <br>
                ftp://example.com/download.zip <br> <br>
                mailto:user@example.com <br> <br>
                file:///home/user/file.txt <br> <br>
                http://example.com/resource?foo=bar#fragment <br> <br>
                /other/link.html (A relative URL, only useful in the context of another URL)</ins> <br> <br></strong>
        <strong> URLs always start with a protocol (http)</strong> and usually contain information such as <strong> the
            network host name
            (example.com) </strong>and often <strong>a document path (/foo/mypage.html). </strong> URLs may have query
        parameters and
        fragment identifiers.</p> <br>


        <h3> URN -- Uniform Resource Name</h3>
        <p> Identifies a resource by name. It always starts with the prefix <strong>urn:</strong> For example: <br> <br>

            <strong> urn:isbn:0451450523 </strong>to identify a book by its ISBN number. <br> <br>
            <strong>urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66</strong> a globally unique identifier <br> <br>
            <strong>urn:publishing:book</strong> - An XML namespace that identifies the document as a type of book. <br>
            <br>
            URNs can identify ideas and concepts. They are not restricted to identifying documents. When a URN does
            represent a document, it can be translated into a URL by a "resolver". The document can then be downloaded
            from
            the URL.
        </p>
        <h3>URI -- Uniform Resource Identifier</h3>
        <p>URIs encompasses both URLs, URNs, and other ways to indicate a resource. <br> <br>

            An example of a URI that is neither a URL nor a URN would be a data URI such as <strong>
                data:,Hello%20World.</strong> It
            is not a URL or URN because the URI contains the data. It neither names it, nor tells you how to locate it
            over
            the network. <br> <br>

            There are also uniform resource citations (URCs) that point to meta data about a document rather than to the
            document itself. An example of a URC would be an indicator for viewing the source code of a web page:
            <strong>view-source:<ins>http://example.com/</ins></strong> . A URC is another type of URI that is neither
            URL nor URN.
        </p> <br> <br>
        <h3>Deferance between URL, URI and URN</h3>
        <p>URI (uniform resource identifier) identifies a resource (text document, image file, etc) URL (uniform
            resource
            locator) is a subset of the URIs that include a network location. URN (uniform resource name) is a subset of
            URIs that include a name within a given space, but no location.</p> <br> <br>

            The text
            specifies the name of the application and indicates the purpose of the window. The title bar also makes it
            possible for the user to move the window using a mouse or other pointing device.</P>
