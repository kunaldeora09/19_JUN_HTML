    <h2>2. Importance of meta tag and Doctypes</h2>

    <!-- Meta Tag -->
    <p><b>Meta tag</b><br> The &lt;meta&gt; tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. &lt;meta&gt; tags always go inside the &lt;head&gt; element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.</p>

    <!-- Doctypes -->
    <p><b>Doctypes</b><br>The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.</p>
